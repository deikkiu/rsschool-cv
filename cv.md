## Brief Self-Introduction:
Hello, my name is Timur, I am 20 years old. I'm studying to be a front-end web developer. I started studying for a frontend developer in September 2022. Six months later, I received my first offer to the web studio. I worked there for 7 months and at the moment I am looking for a new challenge. I want to become not just a frontend developer, but an engineer. I currently live in Astana and am a student of the L.N. Gumilev Eurasian National University. However, I am persistent, fast learner and hardworking. I like frontend and I hope this school will help me achieve my goals.
